/*
  The fundamental idea of unit testing is that you test only one piece of functionality
  in your application that usually is implemented by one function.

  And you test it in isolation â€“ 
  meaning that all other parts of your application which 
  that function depends on are not used by your tests.
  Instead, they are imitated by your tests.
